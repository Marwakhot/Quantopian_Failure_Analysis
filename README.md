# Quantopian Failure Analysis: A PMBOK Framework Assessment

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a comprehensive post-mortem analysis of Quantopian, a fintech startup that raised over $48 million before shutting down in October 2020. The analysis applies Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) principles to identify root causes of failure across three critical management domains: Scope, Risk, and Communication Management.

## About This Analysis

Quantopian was founded in 2011 with the vision of democratizing algorithmic trading through a crowd-sourced platform. Despite backing from prominent venture capital firms including Bessemer Venture Partners, Spark Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz, the company ultimately failed to achieve sustainable operations and was acquired by Robinhood.

This case study examines the organizational and project management failures that led to Quantopian's closure, providing actionable insights for technology startups and project managers in the fintech space.

## Key Findings

### Scope Management Failures
- **Uncontrolled scope creep** extending beyond core platform objectives
- Resource dilution across multiple initiatives (platform, education, hedge fund operations)
- Misalignment between platform capabilities and business objectives

### Risk Management Deficiencies
- Inadequate identification of algorithm performance risks in live markets
- Weak assessment and monitoring systems for hedge fund performance
- Absence of contingency planning for underperformance scenarios
- Slow response to competitive threats

### Communication Breakdowns
- Misaligned expectations between community users and business objectives
- Insufficient transparency with investors regarding fund performance
- Internal misalignment across product, community, and fund management teams
